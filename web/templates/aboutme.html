            <br>
            <p class="space">My name is Dávid Kovács, and I live in Romania. Specifically, I reside in Covasna County, in the village of Torja. I was born on October 9, 2004.</p><p class="space"> I have always been interested in programming and new technologies. I created this page to authentically showcase my current programming skills and knowledge. Among programming languages, I am most proficient in Python, at an intermediate level of proficiency. I will also present a game on the website that I have created. While it's true that when I created this game, my programming knowledge was approximately 25% less than what it is now, but I still believe it's worth showcasing this <a href="{%url 'game'%}">game</a>.</p>

        <p class="space"> Currently, I am actively learning HTML website development, leveraging my Python knowledge with the Django framework, and meticulously designing user interfaces with CSS. I am open to exploring new technologies and languages as necessary to meet the demands of the dynamic and ever-changing field of software development. I passed the high school graduation exam, but I don't have a formal programming degree. Nevertheless, I do possess a certain level of programming knowledge and skills, and I am committed to further enhancing them for more efficient work. Let's dive into my GitHub world!</p>
